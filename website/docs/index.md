Have you ever been working on a project - say, on a new feature - and rushed into commiting your changes,
only to realize later that you forgot to address some important things? 
Perhaps you even had a list of tasks to complete, but you forgot to check it before committing?

If this sounds familiar, then `git-todo` is the tool for you!

With `git-todo`, you can:

- create, view, and manage TODO items directly from the command line
- create, view, and manage TODO items using a simple yet powerful text-mode interface
- automate the management of TODO items using [git hooks](./docs/git-hooks.md)

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-list-status:{ .lg .middle } __Plan, implement, commit__

    ---

    Plan your work, write it down as a TODO list, implement it, and commit your changes - and `git-todo` will help with it.

-   :material-checkbox-multiple-marked-circle-outline:{ .lg .middle } __Never forget about things to do__

    ---

    `git-todo` integrates with your git workflow and will remind you about your TODO items.
